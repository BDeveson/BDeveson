- 👋 Hi, I’m @BDeveson. I am interested in gamma spectrometry and the analysis of the data. I currently have a Radiacode 103 instrument which has a caesium iodide crystal. Currently I am looking at the possibility of dating Australian megafauna bones using gamma spectrometry. I also have an interest in using gamma spectrometry to vector "upstream" in paleochannel uranium mineralisation. I am thinking about getting a gamma spec with a larger caesium iodide crystal.
